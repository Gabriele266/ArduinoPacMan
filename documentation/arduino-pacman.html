		<div>
			<b>Arduino PacMan</b> is a simple tool that simplifies the activities of sharing <b>Arduino projects.</b> <br>
			<central> Once you have done a project, with some <b>sources</b> and using some <b>libraries</b>, it will create for you a simple <br>
				<b>package</b>, with the sources and the libraries used. It will also generate an <b>installation script</b> that will allow <br>
				you to simply install the libraries in the local preferred path. <br>The only thing that you'll have to do is to <b>run the script</b>.
				 <br>
				It will also take care about unpacking the sources into a directory. After this you'll have only to compile the code and... Upload!! <br>

		<div style="align-content: center;">
			<b>Arduino PacMan</b> is written in c++ using the Qt Framework, under the open source licence. The <b>build system</b> used is qmake with gcc in Ubuntu 20.04.<br>
			 The Qt version is 5.15.2 and the language standard is c++ 14. <br>
			 The code is organized into some directories, according to the type of their contents.
			 <ul>
				<li><b>gui</b> Contains all the files related to Graphical widgets or Windows. There are all the forms except the main window, that is away from every folder. </li>
				<li><b>packages</b> Contains all the constructs related to the managing of the packages. E.g. the Package class, that represents a package. </li>
				<li><b>settings</b> Contains all the constructs related to the managing of the settings for ArduinoPacMan. </li>
				<li><b>themes</b> Contains all the constructs used for the managing of the color themes and the themes files. </li>
				<li><b>threads</b> Contains all the classes that represent the different thread launched and used by ArduinoPacMan. </li>
				<li><b>utils</b> Contains a bunch of functions that are useful for the managing of the constructs. </li>
				<li><b>icons</b> Contains all the icons of the project divided by type. </li>
				<li><b>documentation</b> Contains this documentation. </li>

		<div>
			The entry point of the application is the <b style="color: lightblue">main.cpp</b> file located in the home project directory.<br>
			It cares of launching the main window, checking the themes and loading application informations. <br>

			<div>
				The main window is first window that is shown at the startup of the application. It is composed of 3 files: <br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>mainwindow.h</b> Contains the header of the window, with all the declarations of methods and </li>
					<li><b>mainwindow.cpp</b> Contains the implementation of the the functions. </li>
					<li><b>mainwindow.ui</b> Contains the mainwindow graphical design. </li>
				</ul>

				It's the only window that isn't located into the <b style="color: blue">gui</b> directory. This is because it should include all the other windows.
