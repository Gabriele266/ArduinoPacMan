=============================
ArduinoPacMan build informations
=============================

ArduinoPacMan is written using Qt 5.15.2 using GCC as compiler. The qt build system is qmake. 
The c++ standard used is compatible with c++ 14. 
Qt packages used: xml gui core

To build this project clone the contents of the branch that you would compile, except the documentation folder and the schemes folder. NOTE: all the other files are needed. 
Build using Qt-creator. 

==== Other operations to do =====
1) Adding the settings file: In the binaries folder generated by qt, add a copy of the settings.stc file in the folder 'settings' of the branch you have chosen. This file contains all the settings of ArduinoPacMan. If the executable doesn't find it, the program may run into errors or don't start. 

2) Adding the info file: Always in the binaries folder, copy the file info.html from the 'gui' folder of the branch. It contains informations about the lastest news of Arduino PacMan, and is displayed in every home page. If the program doesn't find it, it won't run into errors, but the experience will be worst.

Thank you!!!
